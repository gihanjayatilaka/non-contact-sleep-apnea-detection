# Sleep Apnea Detection

## Objective
Developing a 100% non intrusive method for detecting sleep apnea in infants.

## Approach
A video feed is processed to detect the breathing pattern and then it is assessed for anomalies.

### Algorithms
Canny edge detection, Center of graviry tracking, subspace filtering, adaptive filtering, maxima detection.

### Hardware
Raspberry pi model 3 b
Raspberry pi camera

### Software
Python3, OpenCV
